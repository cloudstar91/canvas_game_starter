# CoderSchool FTW - _ Catching Eggs _

Created with love by: Anh Hoang

This is a simple Canvas-based game that requires a solid understanding of the principles of JavaScript programming to customize.

This game has 2 levels. Instructions:
Level 1: you will catch 12 eggs in 30 seconds to win
Level 2: you will catch 15 eggs in 30 seconds and stay away form obstacles (bomb) to win.

Note: because the bomb will randomly relocated, in case it relocates right on your current position, you will lose. You need lucks to play it as  =]]  -->
